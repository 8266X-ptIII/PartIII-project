Here are some of the model STL files. These are mostly the final versions but there were many leading up to these. 
I've only included the core models though there were many more supplementary models to do smaller things such as hold the electronics. 
These models were created in OpenSCAD, this code has been ommited. The OpenSCAD was exported to Cura for printing.
