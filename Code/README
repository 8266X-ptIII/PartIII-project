Here is much of the code written for the project. Although this is not an exhaustive list.

This includes:

- Code written for Surface Evolver to make numerical solutions for the surface.
- Python code written to analyse the Surface Evolver dumps and compare them to analytical solutions.
- MATLAB code to analyse the images taken this was adapted from Wildeman code [https://github.com/swildeman/fcd] with changes referenced.
- Arduino code to control the motor from the rotary encoder.
